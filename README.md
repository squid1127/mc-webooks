# mc-webhooks

A simple, modular, async webhook listener for Minecraft server events using [this plugin](https://modrinth.com/plugin/minecraftserverapi/), built with FastAPI and Typer. It receives event data from a Minecraft server, processes it, and sends notifications to Discord.

## Archived

After less then a day of existence this project has been archived due to unnecessary complexity it introduced. It will probably be superceded by a much more functional solution in the future.

## Overview

This project provides a webhook server that listens for events from a Minecraft server (e.g., player chat, commands). It's designed to be extensible, allowing you to add new event handlers easily.

- **FastAPI Server**: An asynchronous web server to receive webhooks.
- **Typer CLI**: A command-line interface for starting and configuring the server.
- **Event Handling**: A modular system for processing different types of events.
- **Discord Notifications**: Sends formatted messages to a Discord channel for specific events.
- **Redis Integration**: Can be connected to a Redis instance for data storage (optional).

## Usage

### Using Command-Line Arguments

You can start the server and configure it directly from the command line.

```bash
poetry run mcwh \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8080 \
  --discord-webhook-url "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
```

### Using an Environment File

For a more permanent configuration, you can create a `.env` file in the project root.

```env
# .env
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8080
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
PLAYER_PRIVATE_CMDS='["/login", "/register"]'
```

Then, run the server:

```bash
poetry run mcwh
```

## Configuration

The application can be configured via command-line arguments or environment variables. CLI arguments take precedence over environment variables.
